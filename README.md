### PROJECT DESCRIPTION ###

This is a command-line menu ordering system/application. When run, this program will allow users to select
one of two operating modes (customer or manager), and input commands appropriate to the role chosen. For example,
customers can view a menu and add or modify items for their order as desired. Managers are presented with a
different set of commands. They are able to make changes to the restaurant's menu itself, such as adding, removing,
or modifying the prices of items. 


### HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT ###

To run the program, ensure that all three project files (main.py, customer.py, and manager.py) are together in your working
directory, so that all import statements work correctly. Next, just run the main.py file, which contains the restaurant
definitions, main prompting loop, and the customer mode or manager mode operation functions. 'customer.py' contains most
of the functions related to customer command processing, and 'manager.py' fulfills the same role for manager commands.
All user input, when prompted, can be provided from the command line/terminal. Simply follow the commands/directions printed
to the terminal/console and you should be able to run the project without issues.
